<h1 align="center">About Me <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width=30></h1>
<p align="center">
As mentioned, I am a Full Stack Software Developer based out of Vancouver, WA! I am also a USMC Veteran who served five years on Active-Duty orders as a Ground Intelligence Analyst for 2nd Bn 1st Marines (Infantry) and 11th Marine Regiment (Artillery). 
</p>
<p align="center">
During my honorable service, I received two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals during overseas operations for superior leadership and job proficiency. Towards the end of my service, I was promoted to Sergeant and even appointed as the Regimental Intelligence Chief, a billet that is normally appointed 3 ranks above Sergeant.
</p>
<p align="center">
I had a rather successful career in the military, but I was ready for a new adventure. Why Software Development? As an Intel Analyst, I depended heavily on software to help create accurate and timely assessments for our unit Commander. The software we used was awesome but also needed a lot of work if we were to utilize this in war-time scenario. At that time, I didn‚Äôt know how to create software, nor did I know how or where to submit new ideas for improvement. But eventually, my curiosity began eating me alive, and I had to do something about it. I wished I could of just fixed it myself! Shortly after I separated from the Marine Corps (Honorable Discharge), I started attending a Coding Bootcamp which has helped get me where I am today.
</p>
<p align="center">
I chose to get into Software Development because of the problem-solving/critical-thinking aspect of the job, similar to my past duties as an Analyst. Now, I write code just about every day and enjoy learning about newly released technology in my spare time! Though I really enjoy working with front-end development, I‚Äôve recently grown a huge interest in back-end development too! My ultimate goal is to make a positive impact in my next workspace and to continuously challenge my limits as a Software Developer.
